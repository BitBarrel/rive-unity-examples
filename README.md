See the **getting-started** project. This project contains multiple **scenes** that demonstrate various samples.
- **DrawToCameraScene** - Draws a Rive animation to the camera. Demonstrates passing mouse input to an artboard (listeners) and accessing reported events.
- **DrawToCubeScene** - Draws a Rive animation to a texture and renders to a cube. Demonstrates how to enable listeners in a 3D space by using a Raycast.
- **EventsScene** - Demonstrates how to listen to Rive events.
- **StateMachineInputScene** - Demonstrates how to access and manipulate Rive state machine inputs. Enter play mode to see available inputs in the inspector on the **Main Camera**.

For the other projects be sure to select a **scene** if nothing is rendering.
